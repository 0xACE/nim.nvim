### Contributing to nim.nvim

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

If you want to contribute documentation, please [check the wiki
first](https://github.com/alaviss/nim.nvim/wiki) and add it there if possible
to avoid making the `readme.md` too long. The wiki should contain documentation
about the plugin interfaces as well as how to use them.

If you want to make code changes, please follow this pattern for your commit
messages:

```
<component>: <main changes (don't capitalize the first letter)>

<additional small changes>
```

Examples:

* ftplugin/nim: fixes vsplit goto keymap

* readme: add basic instructions on go to definition feature

  Also reworded the development compiler requirement.
